Reflection

How Do I Interpret User Needs and Implement Them Into a Program? How Do User Stories Help?

Interpreting user needs begins with active listening, stakeholder collaboration, and translating business goals into clear, actionable requirements. In the SNHU Travel project, we worked closely with stakeholders to understand what would deliver the most business value, such as account creation, booking functionality, and itinerary management.

Creating user stories was critical in this process. User stories follow a simple but powerful format:

As a user, I want [functionality] so that [benefit/value].
This structure keeps development focused on user outcomes rather than just technical tasks. User stories also include acceptance criteria, which define what “done” looks like. This reduces ambiguity and ensures alignment between developers and stakeholders.
By breaking large features into manageable user stories, the team could implement, test, and deliver value incrementally. User stories transformed abstract needs into concrete development tasks while keeping the user at the center of every sprint.

How Do I Approach Developing Programs? What Agile Processes Will I Use in the Future?
I approach program development iteratively, focusing on delivering working functionality in small increments rather than attempting to build everything at once. The SNHU Travel pilot reinforced the importance of flexibility, continuous feedback, and collaboration.

Agile practices I plan to incorporate into my future development work include:
Maintaining a well-prioritized product backlog
Writing clear user stories with measurable acceptance criteria
Conducting regular sprint planning sessions
Using daily stand-ups to identify blockers early
Demonstrating working software during sprint reviews
Holding retrospectives to improve team performance

The iterative nature of Agile allows teams to adapt when requirements evolve. For example, when SNHU Travel requested third-party travel insurance integration mid-project, Scrum enabled us to reprioritize without derailing progress. This adaptability is essential in modern software development, where change is constant.
In the future, I also hope to refine estimation techniques (such as story points) and strengthen backlog refinement practices to improve predictability while maintaining flexibility.

What Does It Mean to Be a Good Team Member in Software Development?

Being a good team member in software development means contributing technical skills while also supporting collaboration, accountability, and continuous improvement.
Key qualities include:

Clear and respectful communication
Willingness to help teammates remove blockers
Accountability for commitments
Openness to feedback
Focus on shared sprint goals rather than individual recognition

As Scrum Master, I learned that fostering psychological safety is essential. During retrospectives, team members felt comfortable discussing estimation challenges and suggesting improvements. This openness led to stronger sprint planning and better performance in subsequent iterations.

A good team member understands that software development is not just about writing code—it is about delivering value collaboratively. Success depends on trust, transparency, and a shared commitment to continuous improvement.

Final Thoughts

The SNHU Travel Agile pilot demonstrated the value of Scrum in environments where requirements evolve and stakeholder feedback is essential. Compared to waterfall, Scrum improved adaptability, collaboration, and stakeholder engagement.

This project strengthened my understanding of Agile principles and reinforced the importance of user-focused development, iterative delivery, and effective team communication. It represents my ability to apply Scrum practices in a leadership role and contribute to modern software development methodologies.
